##Notes
1. Use parametrized sql queries to prevent SQL injection


##Stuff that is missing from this tutorial as compared to a real project
1. No defining of schema for the database in code (that was done manually in psql which is not ideal)
2. No use of data or db migrations
3. Did not define a separate folder to store all resource controllers (although i did it)
